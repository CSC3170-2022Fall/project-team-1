## Project Abstract

## Database Design (Temporary)

### Function Points (Temporary)

- The following are fixed (unchangable by consumers or plant owners):
	- Possible chip models: i5, i7, i9
	- Possible operation types: Each chip model has its version of "design-import, etch, bond, drill, test" so totally 15 operation types 
- What consumers can do:
	- Register and log in
	- Appoint plants for configurable packages
- What plant owners can do:
	- Register and log in
	- Accept appointments
	- Publish machines 
- What everybody can see:
	- Chip model introduction (different chip models have different operations, which are of different types) 
	- Plant information (their machines models' feasibility, time, and expense on every possible operation; available number of each machine model)
	- Processing record (visualization; start time, end time, and expense) (display non-ending operations too)
