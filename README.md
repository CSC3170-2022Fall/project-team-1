# CSC3170 Course Project

## Project Overall Description

This is our implementation for the course project of CSC3170, 2022 Fall, CUHK(SZ). For details of the project, you can refer to [project-description.md](project-description.md). In this project, we will utilize what we learned in the lectures and tutorials in the course, and implement either one of the following major jobs:

<!-- Please fill in "x" to replace the blank space between "[]" to tick the todo item; it's ticked on the first one by default. -->

- [x] **Application with Database System(s)**
- [ ] **Implementation of a Database System**

## Implemented Functions

- Chip models, operation types are fixed in this project (unchangeable by consumers or plant owners).
	- Possible chip models: i5, i7, i9.
	- Possible operation types: Each chip model has its own version of "design-import, etch, bond, drill, test" so totally 15 operation types.
- What consumers can do:
	- Sign up and sign in.
	- Appoint plants for configurable packages.
- What plant owners can do:
	- Sign up and sign in.
	- Publish new machine models.
	- Accept appointments.
- What everybody can see:
	- Chip model information.
	- Plant information (See their machines models' feasibility, time, and expense on every possible operation; available number of each machine model).
	- Processing records (Visualizationâ€“â€“Gantt Chart) (Visualize the start and end time).
	- Processing information (Responsive tables) (See the time, expense, and machines related to the operations).

## Program Design

## Directory Structure Explanation

- [assets](assets)
	- JavaScript and CSS files here are used in the source code.
- [frontend](frontend)
	- [shared](shared)
		- Since some webpages share the same UI, putting it in a single file and `require`ing it from those webpages makes us easier to modify the UI code and maintain its consistency.
	- [single](shared)
		- Every frontend file here is only `reuiqre`d by a single PHP file.
- [database](database)
	- [initializaiton.sql](database/initialization.sql): The file was executed upon creating the database in [index.php](index.php). It creates all tables and inserts the default chip models and their operations.
	- [history-of-database-design.md](database/history-of-database-design.md): The file shows how we get the current database design from scrath.
- PHP files begginning with `c-` are webpages for consumers, while `p-` are for plant owners.

## Difficulties Encountered & Solutions

## How to Execute

1. Install an AMP package such as [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org).
2. Start a MySQL/MariaDB server and an Apache web server in the AMP.
3. Download and move this repository to the location of your web server (For XAMPP, it's `xamppfiles/htdocs`).
4. Visit http://localhost/project-team-1-main on your browser (The code has been designed to create the database automatically when you visit [index.php](index.php) for the first time so you don't have to do so manually).
5. To test all functions of the program, follow the steps: Publish machines as a plant owner, appoint plants as a consumer, accept the appointments as a plant owner, and then check the database:
	- Easier way: Check the these webpages: Plant Information, Processing Records, and Processing Information.
	- More fundamental way: Check your database (If you have phpMyAdmin installed, you may do so in a GUI way by visiting http://localhost/phpmyadmin).
