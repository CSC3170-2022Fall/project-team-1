### Function Points (Temporary)

- The following are fixed (unchangable by consumers or plant owners):
	- Possible operation types: 
		- design-import A, etch A, bond A, drill A, test A
		- design-import B, etch B, bond B, drill B, test B
		- design-import C, etch C, bond C, drill C, test C
	- Possible chip models: chip A, chip B, chip C
- What consumers can do:
	- Register and log in
	- Appoint plants for configurable packages
- What plant owners can do:
	- Register and log in
	- Accept appointments
	- Publish machines 
- What everybody can see:
	- Chip type introduction (different chip types have different operations, which are of different types) 
	- Plant information (their machines models' feasibility, time, and expense on every possible operation; available number of each machine model)
	- Processing record (visualization; start time, end time, and expense) (display non-ending operations too)
