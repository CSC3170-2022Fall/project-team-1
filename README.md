# CSC3170 Course Project

## Project Overall Description

This is our implementation for the course project of CSC3170, 2022 Fall, CUHK(SZ). For details of the project, you can refer to [project-description.md](project-description.md). In this project, we will utilize what we learned in the lectures and tutorials in the course, and implement either one of the following major jobs:

<!-- Please fill in "x" to replace the blank space between "[]" to tick the todo item; it's ticked on the first one by default. -->

- [x] **Application with Database System(s)**
- [ ] **Implementation of a Database System**

### Function Points (Temporary)

- The following are fixed (unchangable by consumers or plant owners):
	- Possible operation types: 
		- design-import i5, etch i5, bond i5, drill i5, test i5
		- design-import i7, etch i7, bond i7, drill i7, test i7
		- design-import i9, etch i9, bond i9, drill i9, test i9
	- Possible chip models: chip i5, chip i7, chip i9
- What consumers can do:
	- Register and log in
	- Appoint plants for configurable packages
- What plant owners can do:
	- Register and log in
	- Accept appointments
	- Publish machines 
- What everybody can see:
	- Chip model introduction (different chip models have different operations, which are of different types) 
	- Plant information (their machines models' feasibility, time, and expense on every possible operation; available number of each machine model)
	- Processing record (visualization; start time, end time, and expense) (display non-ending operations too)
