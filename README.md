# CSC3170 Course Project

## Project Overall Description

This is our implementation for the course project of CSC3170, 2022 Fall, CUHK(SZ). For details of the project, you can refer to [project-description.md](project-description.md). In this project, we will utilize what we learned in the lectures and tutorials in the course, and implement either one of the following major jobs:

<!-- Please fill in "x" to replace the blank space between "[]" to tick the todo item; it's ticked on the first one by default. -->

- [x] **Application with Database System(s)**
- [ ] **Implementation of a Database System**

## How to Execute

1. Install an AMP package such as XAMPP.
2. Start a MySQL/MariaDB server and an Apache web server in the AMP.
3. Download and move this repository to the location of your web server (For XAMPP, it's `xamppfiles/htdocs`).
4. Visit `http://localhost/project-team-1-main` on your browser (The code has been designed to create the database automatically when you visit `index.php` for the first time so you don't have to do so manually).
5. To test all functions of the program, follow the steps: Publish machines as a plant owner, appoint plants as a consumer, accept the appointments as a plant owner, and then check the database:
	- Easier way: Check the these webpages: Plant Information, Processing Records, and Processing Information.
	- More fundamental way: Check your database (If you have phpMyAdmin installed, you may do so in a GUI way by visiting `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).

## Database Design

See also [the history of the database design](database/history-of-database-design.md).

## Implemented Functions

- Chip models, operation types are fixed in this project(unchangable by consumers or plant owners).
	- Possible chip models: i5, i7, i9
	- Possible operation types: Each chip model has its own version of "design-import, etch, bond, drill, test" so totally 15 operation types
- What consumers can do:
	- Sign in & Sign up & Sign out
	- Appoint plants for configurable packages
	- Check plant information.
	- Check processing records if there are any packages that have been accepted by plant owners (in responsive tables or visualized charts).
- What plant owners can do:
	- Sign in & Sign up & Sign out
	- Accept appointments
	- Publish machines information
	- Check processing records of the plant in responsive tables or visualized charts.
- What everybody can see:
	- Chip model introduction (different chip models have different operations, which are of different types)
	- Plant information (their machines models' feasibility, time, and expense on every possible operation; available number of each machine model)
	- Processing records (visualization; start time, end time, and expense) (display non-ending operations too)
	- Processing information (the time, expense, and machines related to the operations)

## Program Design

## Directory Structure Explanation
The following are the main structure of the directory:
- project-team-1
    - assets
        - Containing js and css files included in source code.
    - frontend
        - shared
          - Since some web pages share the same ui elements or page design, php files under this directory can share those part using require which can maintain code consistency.
        - single
          - Different from php in shared, files under this directory draw a distinction of frontend among web pages.
    - database
- index.php 
  - Home of the website.
- php files having names begginning with "c-"
  - Functional points for consumer.
- php files having names begginning with "p-"
  - Functional points for plant owner.
- signout.php
  - signout for both consumer and plant owner.
