## Implemented Functions

- Chip models and operation types are fixed in this project (unchangeable by consumers or plant owners).
	- Possible chip models: i5, i7, i9.
	- Possible operation types: Each chip model has its own version of "design-import, etch, bond, drill, test" so a totally 15 operation types.
- What consumers can do:
	- Sign up and sign in.
	- Appoint plants for configurable packages.
- What plant owners can do:
	- Sign up and sign in.
	- Publish new machine models.
	- Accept appointments.
- What everybody can see:
	- Chip model information.
	- Plant information (See their machine models' feasibility, time, and expense on every possible operation; the available number of each machine model).
	- Processing records (Visualizationâ€“â€“Gantt Chart) (Visualize the start and end time).
	- Processing information (Responsive tables) (See the time, expense, and machines related to the operations).

## Presentation

## Directory Structure Explanation

The PHP files were classified into two parts:
- Webpage part (root directory): PHP files here directly serve as the webpages the users can visit. Most of the code is the backend.
- Frontend part (frontend directory): Those here don't directly serve as webpages. Most of the code is the frontend. They indirectly serve as webpages by being `require`d by the PHP files in the root directory.

Distinguishing the frontend and backend makes us easier to divide the work and collaborate more efficiently.

---

Explanation of important directories:
- [assets](assets)
	- JavaScript and CSS files stay here.
- [frontend](frontend)
	- [shared](frontend/shared)
		- Since many webpages share the same UIs (e.g., [homepage.php](frontend/shared/homepage.php), shared by 9 webpages, as shown in the [Function Demo](#consumers)), putting a shared UI in a single file and `require`ing it from those webpages makes us easier to modify the UI code and maintain the consistency across the webpages.
	- [single](frontend/single)
		- Every frontend file here is only `reuiqre`d by a single PHP file.
- [database](database)
	- [initializaiton.sql](database/initialization.sql): The file was executed upon creating the database in [index.php](index.php). It creates all tables and inserts the default chip models and their operation types.
	- [history-of-database-design.md](database/history-of-database-design.md): The file shows how we get the current database design from scratch.
- PHP files in the root directory 
	- Those beginning with `c-` are webpages for consumers, while `p-` are for plant owners (They are not put into one directory because they are not much and staying here makes us easier to see what webpages we have).

## Difficulties Encountered & Solutions

- Database design
	- Overload of high normal forms: In a highly normalized database we tried, the data was not duplicated so table `JOIN`s were required, which made our queries from PHP files more complicated, and thus read times were slower. Solution: No more normalization.
	- Overload of indexing: Improperly created indexes adversely affected `SELECT` queries. Solution: No indexing.
- Programming
	- Division of work: We divided the work into frontend and backend to make our collaboration more efficient.
	- Backend debug: For XAMPP, we checked the web server and PHP log files for the warning and error messages to debug.
	- Frontend improvement: We referred to famous websites for enlightenment.
	- Using the backend features to solve the frontend problem: Since many webpages shared the same frontend, making it just a copy let us modify the frontend code and mantain consistency. This was achieved by `require`ing the shared frontend files.

## How to Run

1. Install an AMP package such as [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org) (or manually install a web server, a MySQL/MariaDB server, and a PHP server).
2. Start a MySQL/MariaDB server and an Apache web server in the AMP.
3. Download and move this repository to the location of your web server (For XAMPP, it's `xamppfiles/htdocs`).
4. Visit http://localhost/project-team-1-main on your browser (The code has been designed to create the database automatically when you visit [index.php](index.php) for the first time, so you don't have to do so manually).
5. To test all functions of the program, follow the steps: Publish machines as a plant owner, appoint plants as a consumer, accept the appointments as a plant owner, and then check the database:
	- Easier way: Check these webpages: Plant Information, Processing Records, and Processing Information.
	- More fundamental way: Check your database (If you have phpMyAdmin installed, you may do so in a GUI way by visiting http://localhost/phpmyadmin).

### Known Issues and Solutions
The code was successfully tested on macOS with PHP 8.1.13 but failed on two Windows machines and some other conditions. Here were the successful solutions:
- Failing to connect the DBMS:
	- Check if you have set a password for your DBMS. If so, change the PHP statement, `$mysqli = mysqli_connect("localhost", 'root', '', "chip_website");
`, in all files of its occurrence, into `$mysqli = mysqli_connect("localhost", 'root', '<your password>', "chip_website");`. 
	- Change the PHP statement, `$mysqli = mysqli_connect("localhost", 'root', '', "chip_website");
`, in all files of its occurrence, into `$mysqli = mysqli_connect("localhost:<port number>", 'root', '', "chip_website");`. (Especially on Windows)

- Failing on the `try` and `catch (mysqli_sql_exception)` statement of PHP: 
	- Remove the whole `try` block in [index.php](index.php), manually create a database named `chip_website`, and populate it with  [database/initialization.sql](database/initialization.sql). (Especially on Windows)
